# ChatGPT-NetworkManager
Here is an example of a simple network manager written in Swift

This network manager provides a load method that can be used to load a Resource object from a network. A Resource is a struct that represents a specific network resource, including the URL of the resource, the HTTP method to use (e.g. GET, POST, etc.), and a closure for parsing the response data into a desired type.

The load method makes an HTTP request to the specified URL using the specified HTTP method and HTTP body (if provided). It then calls the completion handler with a Result object indicating whether the request was successful or not. If the request was successful, the response data is passed to the parse closure of the Resource to be converted into the desired type.

```swift
import Foundation

enum HTTPMethod: String {
    case get = "GET"
    case post = "POST"
    case put = "PUT"
    case delete = "DELETE"
}

struct Resource<T: Decodable> {
    let url: URL
    let method: HTTPMethod
    let body: Data?
    let parse: (Data) -> T?
}

final class NetworkManager {

    private let session: URLSession

    init(session: URLSession = .shared) {
        self.session = session
    }

    func load<T>(_ resource: Resource<T>, completion: @escaping (Result<T, Error>) -> Void) {
        var request = URLRequest(url: resource.url)
        request.httpMethod = resource.method.rawValue
        request.httpBody = resource.body

        session.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
            if let error = error {
                completion(.failure(error))
                return
            }

            guard let data = data else {
                completion(.failure(NSError(domain: "com.example", code: 0, userInfo: nil)))
                return
            }

            if let value = resource.parse(data) {
                completion(.success(value))
            } else {
                completion(.failure(NSError(domain: "com.example", code: 0, userInfo: nil)))
            }
        }.resume()
    }
}
```
### can you explain this code in simpler terms?

Certainly! This code defines a simple network manager class in Swift that can be used to make HTTP requests and parse the response data.

The network manager has a single method, load, which takes a Resource object and a completion handler as arguments. A Resource is a struct that represents a specific network resource, including the URL of the resource, the HTTP method to use (e.g. GET, POST, etc.), and a closure for parsing the response data into a desired type.

The load method first creates an URLRequest object using the URL of the resource. It then sets the HTTP method and body of the request using the values from the Resource object.

Next, the method creates a data task using the URLSession object and passes it the URLRequest object. The data task makes the HTTP request and calls the completion handler when it finishes.

If the request was successful, the method calls the parse closure of the Resource object to parse the response data into the desired type. If the request was not successful, or if the parsing fails, the method calls the completion handler with an error.

Overall, this network manager provides a simple, high-level interface for making HTTP requests and parsing the response data in a Swift application.

### can you explain this again in even simpler terms?

Certainly! This code defines a simple class in Swift that can be used to make HTTP requests and parse the response data. It has a single method, load, which takes a Resource object and a completion handler as arguments.

When you call the load method, it makes an HTTP request to the specified URL using the specified HTTP method and body (if provided). If the request is successful, it calls the completion handler with the response data parsed into the desired type. If the request fails or the parsing fails, it calls the completion handler with an error.

Overall, this class provides an easy-to-use interface for making HTTP requests and parsing the response data in a Swift application.
